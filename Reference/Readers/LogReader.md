# LogReader - Reader

Reads in lines from a text file and converts them to data frames for processing by other components.

## Use Cases

This reader is intended to enable log analysis by reading in formated log entries and allowing listeners and aggregators to track and process the data.

An additional use case is to enable simple log centralization and aggregation. Logs can be read in and sent to a central database, or otherwise converted to a uniform format for centralized processing.
