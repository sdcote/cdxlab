This shows how to run a performance test of a web service using a reader and a WebServiceWriter.

The reader reads in data to send to the web service. It can be a single record or a batch of test data. 

The WebServiceWriter writes the record to the target web service endpoint and then writes the response to another destination. Because ResponseWriters are just regular writers, any destinaton is possible.

To really scale things up, run multiple jobs in different threads/windows.
